<h1>Web-Based Text to Speech Project</h1>
<br>
This repository contains the code for a Web-based Text-To-Speech convertor that I built.
<br>
<h3>Objective:</h3> This project was not built with an academic intent. I built this project so that I could explore JavaScript's <b>SpeechSynthesis API</b>.
<br>
<h2>What is the SpeechSynthesis API?</h2>
The SpeechSynthesis API provides a way to generate synthetic speech from text. 
<br>
Developers can control many factors such as the
<ul>
<li>Voice</li>
<li>Pitch</li> 
<li>Rate and</li> 
<li>Volume of the speech that is generated</li> 
</ul>
The API also lets developers access a wide range of voices and languages that they can use to generate speeches.
<br>
For this particular project I used the <b>Google US English</b> voice, but there are many more voices that one can use.
<br>
